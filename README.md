# Data Science Portfolio by Anjal Hussan

This portfolio is a compilation of varias project references and the notebooks which I created for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and creating Models.

## Capstone Project

#### Integrate Image Recognition technology in Radiology Practice
The purpose of this study is to explore some of the image recognition technology that exists currently and how we can leverage this technology in radiology. This project uses open-source technology to handle the tasks of image processing and classification. The study also seeks to answer various questions, for example: How does image recognition work? How can we integrate image recognition technology with radiology practice? Is image recognition technology reliable? Can Machine Learning (ML) applications help radiologists detect anomalies as well as other abnormalities? The Capstone project write-up can be found  [here](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA698/blob/main/Final%20Paper.pdf). The Python code for Exploratory Data Analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA698/blob/main/eda.ipynb). The Python code for Models and the performance of the models can be found [here](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA698/blob/main/Model.ipynb).
## Classification Projects
#### Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction
This project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately classify Taiwanese companies as either financially stable or at risk of bankruptcy. The project utilizes historical financial data from various companies and applies machine learning techniques to identify patterns and indicators of financial distress.
In this project, I have used the Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction Data Set publicly available in
the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]((https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwanese+Bankruptcy+Prediction)) .
This project uses Random Forest, KNN, SVM methods to create Model and compare the results of the models. The Project details can be found in this [Writeup](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA622/blob/main/HW3/hw3-bankrupt%20prediction.pdf).
The Python code can be found in [this](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA622/blob/main/HW3/HW3%20Predict%20Bankrupt.ipynb) .ipynb file.

#### Natural Language Processing with Python: Gender Prediction from Names
In this project, I used Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers with various features to provide predictions of gender for a English-language name. The dataset used in this project is a labelled corpus of male and female names from the NLTK package: nltk.corpus.names.

In this project, I utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict the gender of English-language names. 
By employing Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers, I was able to analyze various features of names to make gender predictions.
The dataset used for this project is a labeled corpus of male and female names from the NLTK package: nltk.corpus.names.This 
project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms in NLP. The Python code for this project can be found in [this link](https://github.com/ahussan/Projects_DS/blob/main/Project3.ipynb).

#### GLM in R: Generalized Linear Model
For this project I used different predictive modeling techniques with real world data in order to predict if a person has heart disease based on certain factors. The data set for this project [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) can be found on Kaggle. Each observation in this dataset represents a personâ€™s health history, including their age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc. The dataset includes a total of 918 distinct individuals gathered from different countries and agencies. This dataset includes 12 different features, of categorical and/or continous values, of an individual health record, including if the individual has heart disease or not.
The writeup with detail analysis can be found in [this rpub](https://rpubs.com/ahussan/1207459). R code can be found in [this .Rmd](https://github.com/ahussan/Projects_DS/blob/main/Predict%20heart%20disease/Predict%20Cardiovascular%20diseases.Rmd) file.
The writeup and detail analysis can be also found in [this pdf](https://github.com/ahussan/Projects_DS/blob/main/Predict%20heart%20disease/Predict%20heart%20disease%20based%20on%20certain%20Health%20factors.pdf) file.
