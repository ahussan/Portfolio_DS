This portfolio is a compilation of varias project references and the notebooks which I created for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and creating Models.

## Capstone Project

#### Integrate Image Recognition technology in Radiology Practice
The purpose of this study is to explore some of the image recognition technology that exists currently and how we can leverage this technology in radiology. This project uses open-source technology to handle the tasks of image processing and classification. The study also seeks to answer various questions, for example: How does image recognition work? How can we integrate image recognition technology with radiology practice? Is image recognition technology reliable? Can Machine Learning (ML) applications help radiologists detect anomalies as well as other abnormalities? The Capstone project write-up can be found  [here](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA698/blob/main/Final%20Paper.pdf). The Python code for Exploratory Data Analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA698/blob/main/eda.ipynb). The Python code for Models and the performance of the models can be found [here](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA698/blob/main/Model.ipynb).

## Other Projects
#### Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction
This project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately classify Taiwanese companies as either financially stable or at risk of bankruptcy. The project utilizes historical financial data from various companies and applies machine learning techniques to identify patterns and indicators of financial distress.
In this project, I have used the Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction Data Set publicly available in
the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]((https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwanese+Bankruptcy+Prediction)) .
This project uses Random Forest, KNN, SVM methods to create Model and compare the results of the models. The Project details can be found in this [Writeup](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA622/blob/main/HW3/hw3-bankrupt%20prediction.pdf).
The Python code can be found in [this](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA622/blob/main/HW3/HW3%20Predict%20Bankrupt.ipynb) .ipynb file.

#### Natural Language Processing with Python: Gender Prediction from Names
In this project, I used Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers with various features to provide predictions of gender for a English-language name. The dataset used in this project is a labelled corpus of male and female names from the NLTK package: nltk.corpus.names.

In this project, I utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict the gender of English-language names. 
By employing Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy classifiers, I was able to analyze various features of names to make gender predictions.
The dataset used for this project is a labeled corpus of male and female names from the NLTK package: nltk.corpus.names.This 
project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms in NLP. The Python code for this project can be found in [this link](https://github.com/ahussan/Projects_DS/blob/main/Project3.ipynb).

### Natural Language Processing with Python: Document and Text Classification Project
In this project, I implemented various machine learning algorithms to classify documents and text. Using Naive Bayes Classifier, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier, and Logistic Regression, I explored different approaches to accurately categorize text data. The project showcases the application of these classifiers in document classification tasks and performance in handling text data. Through this project, I demonstrated the process of building and evaluating multiple models to achieve optimal classification results.
The Python code for this project can be found in [this Notebook](https://github.com/ahussan/Projects_DS/blob/main/news%20classification.ipynb).

#### Generalized Linear Model (GLM) in R:  Predict Heart Diseases
For this project I used different predictive modeling techniques with real world data in order to predict if a person has heart disease based on certain factors. The data set for this project [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) can be found on Kaggle. Each observation in this dataset represents a personâ€™s health history, including their age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc. The dataset includes a total of 918 distinct individuals gathered from different countries and agencies. This dataset includes 12 different features, of categorical and/or continous values, of an individual health record, including if the individual has heart disease or not.

The writeup and detail analysis can be also found in [this pdf](https://github.com/ahussan/Projects_DS/blob/main/Predict%20heart%20disease/Predict%20heart%20disease%20based%20on%20certain%20Health%20factors.pdf) file.

#### Binary Logistic Regression in R: Crime Risk Prediction

**This is a group project that is part of our Master's program**. In this project, we developed a binary logistic regression model to predict whether a neighborhood is at risk for high crime levels. The objective was to evaluate the impact of various factors on crime risk and to identify the most effective model for accurate predictions. I created and compared six different models:

- **Model 1:** All Variables - Utilized all available variables in the dataset.
- **Model 2:** Hand Pick Model - Selected variables based on domain knowledge and intuition.
- **Model 3:** Backward Step Model - Employed backward stepwise selection to remove variables that were not statistically significant.
- **Model 4:** Forward Step Model - Used forward stepwise selection to add variables that significantly improved the model.
- **Model 5:** Stepwise Model - Combined forward and backward stepwise selection to refine the model iteratively.
- **Model 6:** Transformed Predictors Model - Applied transformations to predictors to improve model performance.

Through this comparative approach, we identified the most effective model for predicting high crime risk in neighborhoods, providing valuable insights for urban planning and public safety strategies.
The R code can be found in [this .Rmd](https://github.com/ahussan/Projects_DS/blob/main/Crime%20Prediction/HW3.Rmd) file. Detail write up can be found in [this pdf](https://github.com/ahussan/Projects_DS/blob/main/Crime%20Prediction/HW3.pdf) file.

#### Regression in R: Car Crash Prediction and Cost Estimation

The purpose of this project is to develop predictive models using multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression techniques. The goal is to predict two key outcomes: the probability that a person will crash their car and the amount of money it will cost if a crash occurs. The project involves building and evaluating multiple models to determine the most accurate predictors.

**Binary Logistic Regression Models**:
- **Binary Model 1:** All Variables - Included all available predictors in the dataset.
- **Binary Model 2:** Hand Pick Model - Selected predictors based on domain knowledge and intuition.
- **Binary Model 3:** Forward Step Model - Added significant predictors incrementally using forward stepwise selection.
- **Binary Model 4:** Stepwise Model - Refined the model using a combination of forward and backward stepwise selection.

**Multiple Linear Regression Models**

- **Multi Linear Regression Model 1:** All Variables - Utilized all available predictors to estimate the crash cost.
- **Multi Linear Regression Model 2:** Hand Picking Variables - Selected predictors based on their perceived impact on crash cost.
- **Multi Linear Regression Model 3:** Stepwise Function - Applied stepwise selection to identify the most significant predictors.
Through this approach, the project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing car crashes and their associated costs, enabling better risk assessment and financial planning for potential car crashes.

#### Data Visualization in R:
This project focuses on the creation of various data visualizations using R to effectively depict and analyze data. By leveraging R's powerful visualization libraries, I generated a range of graphical representations to uncover insights and patterns in the dataset. 
The visualizations include Histogram, Bar charts, Box Plots,    Correlograms, Population Pyramids.
Through these visualizations, the project demonstrates the power of R in transforming raw data into meaningful and interpretable visual formats, facilitating better data-driven decision-making and analysis.
