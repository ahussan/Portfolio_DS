This portfolio is a compilation of varias project references and the notebooks which I created for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and creating Models.

## Capstone Project

#### Integrate Image Recognition technology in Radiology Practice
The purpose of this study is to explore some of the image recognition technology that exists currently and how we can leverage this technology in radiology. This project uses open-source technology to handle the tasks of image processing and classification. The study also seeks to answer various questions, for example: How does image recognition work? How can we integrate image recognition technology with radiology practice? Is image recognition technology reliable? Can Machine Learning (ML) applications help radiologists detect anomalies as well as other abnormalities? The Capstone project write-up can be found  [here](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA698/blob/main/Final%20Paper.pdf). The Python code for Exploratory Data Analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA698/blob/main/eda.ipynb). The Python code for Models and the performance of the models can be found [here](https://github.com/ahussan/DATA698/blob/main/Model.ipynb).
